# AeroSim Asset Library

This repo contains a set of USD assets for the AeroSim simulation.
Only the USD assets (.usd*) are used during runtime. The other files (*.blend) are optional intermediate files (converted from other source formats) that may be helpful during scene/asset preparation stages.

See the [AeroSim repo](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim) for instructions on how to install and use these assets with the sim.
